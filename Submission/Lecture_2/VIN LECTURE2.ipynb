    "Consider the following experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experiment consists of $n$ identical trials.\n",
    "2. The outcome of each trial falls into one of $k$ classes or cells.\n",
    "3. The probability that the outcome of a single trial falls into cell $i$, is $p_i,i = 1,2,...,k$ and remains the same from trial to trial. Notice that $p_1+p_2+p_3+···+p_k =1.$\n",
    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variables of interest are $Y_1 , Y_2 , . . . , Y_k$, where $Y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$. Notice that $Y_1 +Y_2 +Y_3 +···+Y_k =n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "***Answer:***\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = \\sum y \\cdot P(y) = n \\cdot p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the expected value $E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i$, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Defining the expected value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value of $Y_i$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = \\sum_{y_i} y_i \\cdot P(Y_i = y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Use the Joint Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability distribution of $Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_k$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k) = \\frac{n!}{y_1! y_2! \\cdots y_k!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} \\cdots p_k^{y_k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_k = n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Marginal Distribution of $Y_i$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the trials are independent and follow the multinomial distribution, the marginal distribution of $Y_i$ is binomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial probability mass function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Y_i = y_i) = \\binom{n}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n - y_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Expected Value of Binomial Random Variable:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binomial random variable $Y_i$ with parameters $n$ and $p_i$, the expected value is well known:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thus, we have:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, let’s derive this using the definition of expected value explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Derivation Using Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = \\sum_{y_i=0}^{n} y_i \\cdot P(Y_i = y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the binomial probability mass function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = \\sum_{y_i=0}^{n} y_i \\cdot \\binom{n}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n - y_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Simplify the Summation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = \\sum_{y_i=0}^{n} y_i \\cdot \\frac{n!}{y_i!(n - y_i)!} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n - y_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $y_i \\cdot \\frac{n!}{y_i!(n - y_i)!} = n \\cdot \\frac{(n-1)!}{(y_i - 1)! (n - y_i)!} = n \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{y_i-1}$, so we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot \\sum_{y_i=0}^{n} \\binom{n-1}{y_i-1} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n - y_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Adjust the Summation Index:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $j = y_i - 1$. Then the summation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot \\sum_{j=-1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} p_i^{j+1} (1 - p_i)^{n-1-j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when $j = -1$, the term is zero because the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n-1}{-1} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} p_i^{j} (1 - p_i)^{n-1-j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8: Recognize the Binomial Theorem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The summation is a binomial expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} p_i^j (1 - p_i)^{n-1-j} = (p_i + (1 - p_i))^{n-1} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y_i] = n \\cdot p_i \\cdot 1 = n \\cdot p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thus,** the expected value $E[Y_i]$ is indeed $n \\cdot p_i$.\n",
